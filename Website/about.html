			<h3>About InfoKnot</h3>
			<p>Even though companies are trying to simplify tasks for both themselves and their customers, society is being overwhelmed; they're drowning in information. The problem is that people are unable to sort through the mass amount of informations that they are provided.
			<p>Problem: It takes too much time to find what one needs in the storm of noise.</p>
			<p>Common Solution: Make your noise louder.</p>
			<p>InfoKnot Solution: Centralize commonly used resources to speed up repetitive tasks and most importantly, mute anything that doesn’t apply to the user.
			<p>InfoKnot is a custom-fit program developer. We mold services, events, contacts, calendars, etc. to each user individually based on their interests and needs. We help companies tie their services into one easy to navigate and universally accessible (computer, tablet, phone, etc.) format.
